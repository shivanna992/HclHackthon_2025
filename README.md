**Moudyuti Ghosh (worked on the UI implementation using Angular) :**
1. Implemented the different screens for the Admin and Users(Doctors/Nurses/Technician/etc)
2. Implemented the **login page** to login using Email and Password details.
3. Implemented the dashboard which contains
       a. "My Schedule" button for the User
       b. "Manage Shift","Add Staff","See All Staffs" and "Mark Attendance" buttons for the Admin
4. The "**My Weekly Schedule**" Page for the User contains the schedule details and option to Accept / Reject a particular schedule.
5. The "**Manage Shift**" Page for the Admin displays the Staff Schedule and provides the Option to Edit and Save any changes for schedule
6. The "**Add Staff**" form allows the Admin to add new Staff details.
7. The "**See All Staffs**" allows the Admin to see all staff details, sort based on Staff ID and Name and search for a particular staff using name.
8. The "**Mark Attendance**" Page allows the Admin to mark a staff as Present or Absent.
9. Applied **Route Guards** to ensure that authentication is done for different routes. **Have commented out the code since backend API integration using JWT token is pending.**

**Please find below a link to the video for all the screens.**
